# Medallia-test

In order: SQRT sorting, String Sum and Maze test.

All three test coded in python.

SQRT SORTING -  I've used quick sorting in this one.

String SUM - I don't think this is the way it's meant to be done, but here it is. I know there's an algorithm for this, but didn't know how to used it yet.

Maze test -  I've used some kind of Dijkstra algorithm, but couldn't find the shortest path to the exist. I'm working on it, just for personal realisation :).
